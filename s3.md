You are not charged for creating a bucket. You are charged only for storing objects in the bucket and for transferring objects in and out of the bucket. 
After you create the bucket, you cannot change its name.
AWS Management Console allows you to copy an existing bucket's settings to your new bucket.
If we create a bucket from existing bucket it does not copy the bucket policy from the existing bucket to the new bucket.
bucket name must:

Be unique within a partition. A partition is a grouping of Regions. AWS currently has three partitions: aws (Standard Regions), aws-cn (China Regions), and aws-us-gov (AWS GovCloud (US) Regions)
3 and 63 characters

# Enabled ACLs: Useful in scenarios where you need granular control over object-level access and when different AWS accounts or users require specific permissions.

Each object (file) can have a specific ACL that dictates which AWS accounts or users can read, write, or manage it. This is particularly useful in a multi-tenant environment where isolation between different clients' data is crucial.

# Disabled ACLs: Ideal for simpler setups where you want centralized management of object permissions and use bucket policies or IAM policies to control access.

# Block all public access

Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new access control lists (ACLs)

Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any access control lists (ACLs)

Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new public bucket or access point policies

Block public and cross-account access to buckets and objects through any public bucket or access point policies

# Bucket keys
Objects are encrypted  with keys using AWS Key Management Service (KMS)Instead of encrypting at  object level by using bucket keys we can encrypt at bucket level with one key which  reduces the cost of KMS operations.

create a bucket,upload a object , download an object, copy the object, delete the object and bucket.
